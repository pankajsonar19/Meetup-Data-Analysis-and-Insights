But actually Entrepreneurs Anonymous is more about providing a safe place with like-minded people where entrepreneurship can be explored.&nbsp;Entrepreneurs Anonymous events started in Dublin, Ireland in 2011 as accountability group by former students of an entrepreneurship course. The interest for the group grew and now social events with guest speakers are organized every last Tuesday of the month. With a membership increase by 10% each month it was quickly realized last Tuesday-events were simply just not enough for the Anonymous Entrepreneurs.</p>\n<p>B.U.I.L.D&nbsp;was set up to offer more opportunities for Entrepreneurs to learn from each other. B.U.I.L.D&nbsp;stands for Businesses United for Innovation, Learning and Development and is about organizing workshops, seminars, business clinics and networking events for all kinds of entrepreneurs. &nbsp;So far&nbsp;B.U.I.L.D&nbsp;events like the Gigonomy Panel discussion, Customer Journey, Speed Business Networking and the Free Business clinic have been organized.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span>If you have an idea for an event that could be of value for entrepreneurs, apply via <a href=\"http://entanon.com/\">http://entanon.com</a></span></p>\n<p> The best way to register and access all of Entrepreneurs Anonymous/B.U.I.L.D. resources is through our website: </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://entanon.com\">http://entanon.com</a></p>\n<p> <br>You can also follow the hashtag #EntAnon and engage with the group via these pages:-&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Twitter: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/EntAnon-\">https://twitter.com/EntAnon-</a>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Facebook: <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/EntAnon-\">https://www.facebook.com/EntAnon-</a>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>",

This is a group for people who wish to meetup and go for walks along the coast on the dart line from Greystones to Howth, we may at times go to Glendalough or Powerscourt in Co. Wicklow, and other locations. </b> &lt;br&gt;</p>\n<p><i><b>This is the third year of the Group, which was initially set up in 2015, and this year the group has </b></i></p>\n<p><i><b>1 Organiser, 2 Co-Organiser and 7 Assistant Organisers </b></i><i><b>all of whom will schedule walks in the year. </b></i></p>\n<p><i><b>Any member of the group can host a walk if they want to and we welcome new walks in addition to the existing walks that we do on a regular basis. </b></i></p>\n<p><b>Annual Membership</b> &lt;br&gt;</p>\n<p>Annual Membership Fee is 5.00 euros payable by PayPal in January 2018. &lt;br&gt;</p>\n<p>You will see instructions on how to pay this fee when you join the site.</p>\n<p><b>Meeting point for Walks</b></p>\n<p>Most of our Meetup points for our Walks are on the dart line, we meet at the outside of the dart station, which is convenient for most people, and many of the dart stations do have access to car parking for around 4 euros per day. </p>\n<p>All our walks are followed by tea/coffee or lunch which is optional.</p>\n<p><b>Pace of Walks</b></p>\n<p>All are walks are for the normal/medium pace walker. </p>\n<p> <br><b>IMPORTANT NOTICE RE INSURANCE PLEASE READ </b> &lt;br&gt;</p>\n<p><b>Insurance: Please note: this activity is taken at your own risk, and the organiser has no responsibility for any injuries or damage.</b></p>\n<p><b>Personal Insurance for Walkers and Charges please visit Mountaineering Ireland website for annual charges:</b></p>\n<p><b>Membership of the 'Mountaineering Council of Ireland' provides insurance for walkers; please click below for details of the charges.</b></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.mountaineering.ie/membersandclubs/Membershipfees_and_Benefits/default.aspx\">http://www.mountaineering.ie/membersandclubs/Membershipfees_and_Benefits/default.aspx</a></p>\n<p><b>Health &amp; Safety: Events are organised with H&amp;S in mind (max numbers, no unsafe venues/destinations tc.), however, each member attends events at their own risk. &lt;br&gt;</b></p>\n<p><b>Coastline Walks do not have Accidental Insurance cover for members going on walks and members are responsible for their own safety and they attend all meet-ups at their own risk.</b></p>\n<p><b>If a member has any health issues they must ensure that they have their Doctors permission to take part and health issues must be declared to the walk organiser when you join as some of the walks may not be suitable for there fitness level, i.e. Cliff Walk or Howth loop walks, where there may be a bit of a climb or the walks are more strenuous. The flat walks would probably be more suitable for them. </b></p>\n<p><b>By signing up to this meet-up group and attending the walks you acknowledge that you accept responsibility for your own safety at all meet-ups. </b></p>\n<p> ============</p>\n<p>We are also a group for social events, day tours, meeting for tea/coffee, going to cinema or theatre in the evening or weekend, places of history/interest, markets and are always welcome to hear of new suggestions from members for a new meetup and also for them to offer to host a meetup of their choice.</p>\n<p>This is a good way to get some exercise in, meet people, unwind, exchange ideas for new meetup events, relax and chat, laugh and enjoy a nice afternoon, especially at the weekend after working most of the week, good to get away from the hustle and bustle of a busy week, and also get some exercise in and feel refreshed after the nice walks.</p>\n<p>This is a friendly pleasant group for people who like a walk by the sea, lovely scenery, fresh air and also good company and coffee and also a choice of long walks.</p>\n<p>We all know that the health benefits from walking are numerous - it is very good for our heart and also enhances our physical and emotional health. It activates soothing neurons in the brain, these neurons help dull feelings of stress , which we all can experience now and then,. Walking 20 minutes a day not only boosts memory - but also improves the walker's brain function. It is good to get out in the fresh air with a group of people and enjoy the lovely views on these walks, nature and beautiful scenery in the summertime and perhaps more so in the wintertime, when some people may feel more isolated.</p>\n<p>Walking slowly not only burns more calories per mile, it is easier on the joints and may also save wear and tear on the joints. Walking is an aerobic exercise. Studies found that people who walked had less body fat than those who didn\u2019t walk. It also lowers the risk of blood clots, since the calf acts as a venous pump, contracting and pumping blood from the feet and legs back to the heart, reducing the load on the heart. </p>\n<p>Nice long walks - all of our walks along the coast are at least two hours total walk minimum, as I feel if a member goes to the trouble of getting on a dart or driving to a Walking Meetup , a shorter walk would not be worth there journey. &lt;br&gt;</p>\n<p><b> oooooooooo</b> &lt;br&gt;</p>\n<p><b>Some simple rules for new members joining:</b> &lt;br&gt;</p>\n<p><b>Walks/Meetups</b></p>\n<p>We would ask members to please change your rsvp to NO as soon as you know that you cannot attend a walk/meetup to allow other members to avail of it, (especially in the summer months) instead of leaving it to the morning of the walk which is probably too late then for people who may already have made arrangements for the weekend. </p>\n<p>For members attending the walks please wear suitable warm clothing and comfortable suitable footwear and socks and bring a drink/snack/fruit with you on the meetup. We normally meet at the dart line or a convenient central location for members but whilst we can wait ten minutes or so for members after the meetup time (i.e. train/bus delays) we would then have to go ahead with the meetup as it would be unfair to the rest of the group who may have other commitments later in the day. We do not hold a list of mobile numbers for members so if a member is late unfortunately it will result in them missing the group. &lt;br&gt;</p>\n<p>While it may be nice to wear open sandals in the warm weather it is very easy to get a twisted ankle while wearing this type of footwear most especially on the Cliff Walk and the Killiney Hill walk. particularly where there is an absence of a tarmaced path and possible inclement weather - So again please remember the importance of wearing proper walking footwear (versus wearing an old pair of shoes/ankle boots with heels !, sandals, or canvas shoes), nobody needs to be getting a twisted ankle etc that could have been avoided by suitable footwear being worn. Also if anyone has suffered a back injury in the past they would need to ensure that they have the right type of footwear for walks and also insoles, to avoid back pain after the walk. &lt;br&gt;</p>\n<p><b>Group Rules:</b> &lt;br&gt;</p>\n<p>The group is intended to be relaxed, informal and friendly. As a minimum, the following code of conduct is expected of all members:</p>\n<p>No verbal abuse of the organisers/other members </p>\n<p>No monitoring/questioning other members attendance</p>\n<p>No using the group for commercial enterprise </p>\n<p>(members account will be deleted if the site is used for this purpose) &lt;br&gt;</p>\n<p>Any members in breach of this code will be removed from the group.</p>\n<p><b>Details on Meetups</b> </p>\n<p>\u2022 It is important that members read their emails on the site daily for any changes to the dates or times of the meetup. </p>\n<p>\u2022 We are not responsible for members turning up to events that have been cancelled and have been given prior notice of cancellation. </p>\n<p> <b>As Organisers we dont take any responsibility for any accidents while out walking or if anyone has an issue with a restaurant/bar food etc. and is unhappy with the service or food, they would need to sort this issue out themselves at the time.</b></p>\n<p>We hope you will enjoy this meetup group. There are lots of coastal walks that are lovely in the summer months, especially the Cliff Walk Bray to Greystones, Killiney Hill and Dun Laoghaire to Sandycove Harbour and Dalkey, Greystones to Kilcoole, Malahide to Portmarnock, Portmarnock to Howth and Clontarf to Howth. &lt;br&gt;</p>\n<p>Looking forward to meeting up soon.</p>\n<p>&lt;br&gt;</p>\n<p>Meetup Organisers</p>\n<p>Coastline &amp; River Walks 40 plus</p>",

As companies are becoming more and more agile, and see how they can now adapt in order to innovate and compete faster than their competition, software development teams are being forced to maintain and evolve large, monolithic applications at a pace of change that those architectures were never meant to withstand, let alone embrace!</p>\n<p>Microservices are a new approach to architecting applications. They are simple, single-purpose, lightweight architectural components that enable you to deliver software faster. The microservice architectural approach also aims to lead to software that thrives on change while at the same time being secure, performant, and stable.</p>\n<p>This meet up is for people interested in architecting, designing, deploying and maintaining micro service based software architectures.</p>",

            "description": "<p>Wicklow hiking and adventure group is for people of all ages who enjoy the great outdoors. We have had people on our hikes from age 15 to 74, all are welcome! The social aspect of our group is hugely important and the laid back convivial atmosphere is paramount to what we do. The main rule is, come out to enjoy yourself, have a laugh and unwind. We ask for a contribution of \u20ac1 per hike this covers the renewal fees meetup charges to keep the page active, purchasing maps and when a bus needs to be subsidised for low numbers,the remainder will be put towards social events. Our walks do not have leaders, our organisers are a voluntary bunch who take the time to work out routes and share their knowledge of them, they are not responsible for you in any way. I would recommend to those unsure about hiking and requiring structured, supported guidance to consider a hiking club rather than a social meetup group. Members must update their RSVP 24 hours before a hike so as to be fair to members on the waitlist, failure to do this will result in membership being revoked. As this is a hiking group please prepare yourself adequtely with the proper kit for our hikes. Proper sturdy walking boots with ankle support aswell as warm comfortable clothing are to be recommended, it is very much advised to pack a waterproof jacket and trousers also as weather can vary. I look forward to seeing you all out with my group, supported as I am by my fantastic team of event organisers. And please always remember our most important 'rule' get out there and enjoy yourself! Enda :) Posting to the meetup group page and contacting other members: Members are reminded that the meetup group page is a fantastic facility and we encourage everyone to use it in a fun, respectful and goodwilled manner. We do not tolerate: People discussing other groups, their activities or their members on our group page. Members contacting other members be it by public or private means before firstly agreeing to such on the group meetup page. I.e. you ask the person on the open group forum, you do not send to their private email without their expressed consent. Either of these infringements will result in your removal from the group. These rules for the vast majority are never an issue, it is important however that we are all clear. We look forward to seeing you out with our group! :)</p>",

When joining a walk, rather than relying on the information provided, it is strongly recommended that individual walkers verify its correctness. We reminds every walker that joins the group, that it is each individual\u2019s responsibility to approach outdoor activities, such as walking, with caution. Walking can be demanding and it is the responsibility of each individual to ensure they are fit enough to complete the distance before joining any walk. If there are any doubts a \u2018would be\u2019 walker should consult their G.P. Not all trails are on solid and even surfaces therefore it is each walkers individual responsibility to look after their own safety and not the liability of the Walking club and it's organisers.</span></p>",

It\u2019s not specific to singles and hopes to attract people from all corners of the world. The idea behind the group\u2019s formation is that you can enjoy life in Ireland with like minded people, doing fun things that don\u2019t necessarily revolve around drink or a pub. The group doesn't exclude people who like a drink BTW. There are a huge variety of events / activities happening in Ireland, and it can be made all the more enjoyable as part of a welcoming, friendly group. Activities / events in this group include live gigs, hill walks, language exchange, simple afternoon coffee, browsing markets and many, many more. This group will allow you to make new friends and enjoy the craic without the dreaded hangover the next day. I would love the input of new members to shape the direction of this group so if you want to see the sober side of Ireland jump on board and join our club today! If you need any more info call Dave on 087 610 2363.</p>\n<p><b>Disclamer</b></p>\n<p><b>It's each person's responsibility to approach outdoor activities with caution.

In the event of an accident causing injury of any kind, Sober Slice is not liable.</b></p>",

            "description": "<p><span>Hello there!</span></p>\n<p><span>We'd like to welcome you to our <span><strong>FREE</strong></span> weekly Sahaja Yoga meditation meetings which take place in Dublin on Fridays.</span></p>\n<p><span>With Sahaja Yoga Meditation we normally sit on chairs to achieve yoga, effortlessly &amp; spontaneously. So there is no need for mats and no special clothing required.</span></p>\n<p><span>We are all volunteers of a Charity organisation and have many years of experience in offering free Sahaja Yoga Meditation classes.</span></p>\n<p><span><span>All across the globe, many are seeking new sources of energy. Meanwhile, the most <strong><span>transformative energy</span></strong> of all is hiding in plain sight, within us. It's natural, sustainable, and infinitely renewable. It's called inner kundalini energy. And everyone already has it \u2014 everyone!. It is often likened to an inner feminine or motherly energy which automatically knows about us and what is needed to help us <strong><span>restore balance and harmony</span></strong> within our subtle being. It works spontaneously, effortlessly, organically and cannot be paid for.</span></span></p>\n<p><span>The classes are designed to help those attending get into a genuine meditative state, which can be felt tangibly. It is <span><strong>quite effortless and spontaneous</strong>.</span></span></p>\n<p><span>The free classes feature introductory talks, video's, practical workshops and general question and answer opportunities, making them perfect for seekers trying to establish a <strong><span>state of yoga</span></strong>, and they are available across London most evenings and throughout the UK.</span></p>\n<p><span>The idea is that you don't do yoga - you Achieve Yoga!</span></p>\n<p><span>Sahaja Yoga Meditation is a simple, time-honored technique. It helps those who enjoy it, <strong><span>reduce stress and <span>increase wellness.</span></span></strong> It brings better focus and helps people become more centered and better balanced. Anyone can do it.</span></p>\n<p><span>Founded by Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi, Sahaja Yoga Meditation is a world wide movement for <span><strong>peace and self awakening</strong></span>.</span></p>\n<p><span>All the meetings and classes are free of any charge. Each week we go through <span><strong>simple meditation techniques</strong></span>, often with guided meditations to help <strong><span>r</span><span>e</span></strong>duce stress and achieve the peace</span> of true meditation.</p>\n<p><span>We share tips on how to help stay in balance during the day and how to meditate at home. The meditation is based on connecting with the inner chakras (energy centres) and balancing the subtle body.</span></p>\n<p><span>The tradition and aims of meditation are explained which in essence is to be in the present with <strong><span>no mental activity or thoughts</span></strong> about the past or the future.</span></p>\n<p><span>Occasionally there are 1 day retreats to help those interested, deepen their individual experience and hear advice and tips from those who have been practicing for some time. It\u2019s ultimately all about getting into \u2018thoughtless awareness\u2019, a <span><strong>natural state</strong></span> of being.</span></p>\n<p>We have a web site in London too which you can visit if you are ever there for more info about weekly meetings:<a href=\"http://www.sahajayogalondon.co.uk/\">www.sahajayogalondon.co.uk</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.sahajayogalondon.co.uk/\"></a>Join us on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/London.Free.Meditation\">Facebook</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/SahajL\">Twitter</a></p>\n<br>\n<br>",

            "description": "<p>We are a group of regular Nordic Walkers, based in North County Wicklow. &nbsp;Nordic Walking uses specific walking poles which give a good upper body workout and great support. You dont have to use the Nordic poles, or even poles, if you want to walk with us, but most of the group chose to use them. Walks take place during the week (usually Tuesdays) and on Saturdays and Sundays and are posted up on the site here.</p>\n<p>The Saturday morning walks are the best for \"starters\" and usually take place on Kilruddery Estate where there is a great range of terrains - fields, woods, open hillside and bog! These walks are usually two hours in duration and the pace is usually moderate, depending on the group....</p>\n<p>Saturday afternoon walks vary in location - usually within County Wicklow, but occasionally we travel a little. We have done most of the Wicklow Way and the majority of &nbsp;peaks in County Wicklow, and in all types of weather!! We also do day trips and weekends away - in the past few years we have been to the Comeraghs, Galtymore, Slievenamon, Lugnaquilla, Clogherhead and have done some of the Kerry Way. In the autumn of 2016 we visited Westport and of course, cycled the entire Greenway. Last year we visited the French Alps for a three night trip and &nbsp;are heading to Austria this year. We occasionally combine a walk with a site visit and have visited many castles and stately homes over the past six years. We have even done a few boat trips.... Plans are afoot for a number of trips away this year also as well as some social events. Many of the regular walkers have become friends on the way, so we could be regarded as more than just a walking group.</p>\n<p>Our group are best described as \"moderate to good walkers, with their own transport\" and we are a lively and friendly group and make new walkers very welcome. Anyone joining us must have walking boots, good rain gear, a rucksack with a basic first aid kit and a sense of humour. We also carpool, so you must be prepared to take your turn. Please note that there is a charge of \u20ac8 per walk and I supply poles to those who would like them, and I organise all events.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If this sounds like a group you would be comfortable with, we would be delighted to meet you...</p>",

This is the continuation of our old, well-loved Language Exchange Meetup Group, which has, in one guise or another, been running (mostly in various Galway pubs :)) since 2010. It's just a relaxed social group that meets on Monday evenings over a pint or two (or other poison of your choice) for people to get a chance to practice different foreign languages they are learning or have learnt, so remember, the more languages (and people) the merrier! <br>We usually get a good mix of English, Spanish, French, German speakers, with sometime smatterings of Italian, Portuguese, Japanese etc etc. The group has always been nice and lively, so I hope you join us to help keep it so! Every language is welcome!! :)</p>",

The group started after Geraldine Curran the previous organiser returned to Galway after being away for almost 20 years, and found all of her friends had settled down, or moved away. My own story mirrors Geraldine's experience. Furthermore, I am driven by the importance of being social in an increasingly antisocial online world. We\u2019ve experienced the emergence of one dimensional communications on Facebook, WhatsApp and Tinder etc, which are great in there own small way but nothing beats meeting up in person and sharing conversation, experiences and laughter. So come on, be bold, get involved, come to our events and meet like-minded people and share some laughs and quality experiences. Maybe even create your own event or get together... I look forward to seeing you there!</p> \n<p>Make new friends to socialise with, new colleagues, new mentors, new team mates, new business partners, come join us on a night out, or a daytime event. Check out the calendar of upcoming events and simply RSVP to the ones that interest you most.</p> \n<p>To contact us, join the group and/or send a message via the contact link below.</p> \n<p><a href=\"mailto:galwaysocialcontact@gmail.com\">galwaysocialcontact@gmail.com</a></p> \n<p>In Galway we love to meet new people!

You can even come to listen Spanish and talk to us in English if you want.</p>\n<p>Alternate Description: <br></p>\n<p> This groups is about spending time in a language we all have good memories about. It's about practicing it so it doesn't go away with the passage of time. It is about spending time with people that make you laugh and become close friends. It is about many things, we hope all of them good. All it takes is a bit of effort to join the meetups :) Don't worry about making mistakes, nobody is perfect. And when one is learning a new language, making mistakes is part of the deal. What's important is that you make them in a group where you can always learn new things. <br></p>",

All the photo fans in the area are more then welcome to join the group. The group is to meet people with the same interest, chat, have workshops &amp; projects, do photography day trips together. Feel free to give feedback &amp; ideas, I want a group with a good interaction.\u00a0</p>\n<p><br>\n\n</p>\n<p><br>\n\n</p>\n<p>I am in Galway since april to improve the english language &amp; to get experience abroad. For me Galway is one of the best places in the world, I really love it, a perfect mix from the people, nightlife, landscape &amp; sea. I studied photo design, so I know somethings about photoshop &amp; co, but I am really not an expert. But feel free if you have questions :-) From the pictures I am really interested in all kinds of pictures, maybe with a focus on people &amp; landscape. And I am a big black &amp; white picture fan.</p>\n<p><br>\n\n</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://view.stern.de/de/profile/wind_chime/\" class=\"linkified\">http://view.stern.de/de/profile/wind_chime/</a></p>\n<p><br>\n\n</p>\n<p><br>\n\n</p>\n<p><br>\n\n</p>\n<p>PS This is not a official group or organisation.

            "description": "<p><span><i>What is our Meetup Group about?</i></span> <br></p>\n<p>There exists a golden thread, which leads out of the labyrinth of our broken reality and towards the Truth. The Lectorium Rosicrucianum, or International School of the Golden Rosycross, aims to help seekers find and form a living connection with this shining filament, which is woven of love, wisdom, knowledge (gnosis) and action.&nbsp;<br><br>Most importantly, this golden thread is a Path that can actually be walked, a Path shown by all religions in their original form. No Master or Initiate can give the Truth to another. It can only be approached by our own efforts, and by persevering throughout all the obstructions and difficulties we encounter on the way. And it can only be reached through an inner process of transformation called 'soul-rebirth', or 'transfiguration'. A bonafide School points out the Path of transfiguration and teaches its pupils how to follow it.&nbsp;<br><br>It is not the I-central self, or personality, that profits from the process of transfiguration as meant here, but the inner, divine Self, which is awakened and enabled to become increasingly active. This has tremendous results for the personality: he or she becomes an instrument, a servant, of another Order, the Divine Order, the 'kingdom not of this world', and in that state is able to stand right in the midst of the world in the service of every human being.&nbsp;<br><br>The Lectorium Rosicrucianum is a modern organization in the sense that its message is adapted to the strongly individualized consciousness of twentieth and twenty-first century humanity. However, it has deep roots in the past, for it is part of the long and ancient tradition of Mystery Schools, and is a development of earlier impulses of spiritual awakening such as those of the gnostics, Albigenses, Cathars and classical Rosicrucians of the 17th century.</p>\n<p>If you would like to learn more about the ideas of the School please download the introductory brouchure <a href=\"http://www.goldenrosycross.ie/#!introductory-brochure/cb7n\">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><i><br></i></p>\n<p><i>Who should join?</i><br></p>\n<p>Any serious seeker on the path of self initiation. <br> <br></p>\n<p><i>What members can expect:</i><br></p>\n<p>\u2022&nbsp;Lectures with Q&amp;A</p>\n<p>\u2022&nbsp;Contemplative Meetings</p>\n<p>\u2022&nbsp;Symposiums</p>\n<p> <br></p>\n<p>Contact us:</p>\n<p><b><a href=\"http://www.goldenrosycross.ie\">http://www.goldenrosycross.ie</a></b></p>",

            "description": "Simply put CorkSec is a monthly meetup for anyone interested in Information Security in the Munster region (primarily Cork). Regardless of whether you identify yourself as an InfoSec Professional, a Hacker, a Researcher, a Student or just someone with an interest in breaking things to see how they work / stopping people breaking things to see how they work - all are welcome, and please invite your like-minded friends. CorkSec is modeled on the idea of a DefCon Group - In fact its got an official Defcon Group code of DC021353. The ideas behind a Defcon Group embodied a lot of what we want to achieve with CorkSec: - Meetings are open to anyone, regardless of their skill, age, job, gender, etc - Meetings are designed to help you learn new things, meet new people, mentor others in areas you may be strong in, and provide some cohesion within the security/hacker culture and it's members - Each meeting will have 1-2 technical talks given by local members of the Cork security/hacker community with occasional guest speakers In particular we'd like to draw attention to Defcon FAQs answer for \"Is this a Hacker Meeting?\": No, this is something better. Anything with the \"hacker\" label on it tends attract only one kind of person. This meeting is designed to attract not only hackers but members of the InfoSec community and people who want to learn more about InfoSec but do not consider themselves hackers. The purpose here is to interact with people who may have different backgrounds but share the same passion for technology. Many security people feel that hackers are nothing but trouble and many hackers feel that security people are clueless. Those generalizations are often made in error and we'd like to bring all techno-dweebs back under a single umbrella. So come on down and enjoy!",

In fact, if we look at the motivations behind our thoughts and action conscious and unconscious they are all to get us closer to the feeling, or at least the idea, of happiness.&nbsp;</b></p>\n<p><b>Some of us have long asked why we cannot hold on to happiness. For all of the scholarship and human insights across the centuries, nobody has found a complete and enduring answer. Perhaps because it has been too close to see\u2026&nbsp;</b></p>\n<p><b>The answer, the key, is our heart.\"&nbsp;</b></p>\n<p>~ Irmansyah Effendi, M.Sc., Founder Padmacahaya Institute&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>Open Heart Meditation</b> is a very easy-to-learn, heart-centered meditation that helps you experience the peace and joy that is already within your heart, through the simple technique of relaxing, smiling and surrendering.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>We have regular Meetups on Monday &amp; Friday evenings, as well as other events throughout the year.&nbsp;</b>At the Meetup we will walk you through the basic steps (relax, smile and surrender) of heart meditation so you can become familiar with the process, then we will do the Open Heart Meditation together.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>Open Heart Meditation</b> is a beautiful, guided meditation that connects our hearts to True Source, the Source of Love &amp; Light (we use the non-denominational term \"True Source\" but you a free to use whatever word feels right for you- God, Spirit, Universe etc...). The Open Heart Meditation also helps cleanse negative energy and emotions from your heart and replace it with Love &amp; Light in a very gentle, effortless way.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Most people feel very relaxed and peaceful after the Open Heart Meditation. With practice, as our heart becomes stronger, we become more peaceful, joyful and able to follow our heart's own inner guidance to be happier in our daily life.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>Reiki Tummo</b> is a gentle, yet effective, form of energy healing based on the heart. In Reiki Tummo we rely on our heart connection to channel Reiki, Divine Energy, to others and ourselves. With thousands of practitioners worldwide, Reiki Tummo has safely and successfully helped countless people all over the world. Reiki Tummo combines the Divine energy of Reiki with Kundalini fire for accelerated healing and cleansing of all the chakras. Reiki Tummo participants immediately have the ability to channel Reiki Tummo energy. In addition, the non-physical heart is accessed and strengthened. It is very good for relieving stress, clearing stuck emotions and energetic blockages, helping to bring balance and healing to your whole being. <br></p>\n<p>Click on our <a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/Open-Heart-Cork/pages/About_Open_Heart_Meditation/\">Pages</a> above for more info.</p>\n<p>If you have any questions please contact us.

            "description": "<p>This is a group set up to bring women together. Maybe some of us are young single women, or some of us are in a relationship or even married and yes we can get bored. So what can we do to add some spice into our lives, we call a friend who is settled and unable to go out for a couple of months. No! we join this meetup group so there is always someone to go out with. This site gives you the opportunity to go out with the girls have chats, dinners and dancing. You get to make new friends and get the opportunity to do all sorts of things together. With this meetup the idea is that its all women together which is very attractive to the opposite male sex that 'We are Girls having fun'! Lets enjoy doing this and we can have our own parties at home or away or whatever the group decides. Life is for living so lets live it!</p> \n<p>We cater for girls in their late 30's to 40's but all ladies are invited as there is some things that can suit all.Please include a Clear picture of only yourself on your profile and mobile number privately to me for future events. If you try to join without a picture of yourself you wont be accepted. If you join and remove your picture later then you will also be removed from the group.if you try to start up other groups within the group you will be removed from the group. Everything you do in the group is at your own risk, so always be careful of yourself. If you add yourself to an event make sure you go and if you cant make it remove your name and comment on the page before the event begins. If you don't comment for 3 events after adding yourself and not turning up you will be removed. This group is full of positive energy and its always good to look out for one another. I invite you to enjoy every moment you spend here and I hope you take a positive experience from it. For this group only wants women who mind the group and each other. Im sure you will enjoy and ill see you soon for some great events.</p>",

It's not about delivering an elevator pitch onstage or a \"demo day\" presentation, or trying to grab a few seconds with an angel investor or potential customer. Unpitch is a chance to explore your business idea in a casual, no-pressure environment; practice your pitch in a compressed 5-minute presentation and get feedback and questions for another 5 minutes that will help you get to the next stage.</span></p>",

If you're a fan of chilling out over a cup of coffee, the outdoors, the cinema, dance classes, day trips, surfing, picnics in the park, biking and much more besides, this could be the group for you...</p>\n<p>Perhaps it's just me, but since giving up the drink I've come to notice how my old drinking social framework doesn't seem to adapt well to my new non-drinking lifestyle. I'd like to form this group for all non-drinkers out there to get together and bond over a coffee or picnic in the park or whatever else we decide. I think it'd be nice to meet other non drinkers out there to form a group and find out together how to have the craic on the dry in Cork City :) Everyone is welcome, bring your friends if you like and I promise you'll meet a group of lovely and welcoming people.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>NB: this isint a teetotallers group exclusively, people who drink outside of this group are welcome too, but with the understanding that any meet ups we do have would involve zero alcohol.&nbsp;</p>",

This group isn\u2019t limited to bitcoin. We discuss all potential blockchain, altcoin and ICO technologies which are all very exciting places at the moment. The future success of virtual currencies depend on adoption in the real world and the best way to accomplish that is by building local communities that understand the far reaching benefits that cryptocurrency offers. </p>\n<br>\n<p>Disclaimer:</p>\n<p>It is inevitable that financial systems and cryptocurrency investment will be discussed amongst the group members. Any conversations solicited or unsolicited with group members should not be taken as financial advice and are not endorsed by me or the meetup group. We are a group with a shared interest in technology. We are not an investment group or club. Buying cryptocurrency is the trading of real money for virtual tokens with no intrinsic value. Any investments made in cryptocurrency are entirely at your own risk. That being said we are a group discussing technology and financial systems and I don\u2019t want to limit the scope of conversations. So caveat emptor!</p>\n<br>",

And so, here we are.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>Everybody's Book Club</b></p>\n<p>This book club belongs equally to all of its members. Please feel free to suggest books that are of interest and to make full use of the forums and all the cool features MeetUp has to offer.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>Where, when, how, what?</b></p>\n<p>Again - let's all contribute suggestions to answer these questions. I propose the following:</p>\n<p>\u2022&nbsp;Meet up once per month</p>\n<p>\u2022&nbsp;To read one book per month</p>\n<p>\u2022&nbsp;To switch between pubs, caf\u00e9s and even restaurants (dinner out)&nbsp;<br></p>\n<p>\u2022 Let's choose a fixed day of the week/time that suits the majority best?

            "description": "<p>We all know the feeling of being in an uncomfortable or new environment \u2013 we may feel shy, nervous, or unsure of ourselves. Imagine this became so acute that just being in the company of other people or the thought of a future interaction could induce anxiety, panic attacks, breathing difficulties, or nausea. This is the reality for 1 in 8 people in Ireland today who are experiencing Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD). SAD is an irrational fear of social situations and interactions, which can lead to the onset of other issues if not confronted, such as depression, alcoholism or drug abuse, and the inability to obtain or maintain employment.</p> \n<p>Step Out Ireland provides a welcoming and safe environment for people to step out of their anxiety and make new connections, thereby increasing confidence and a sense of belonging. We organise support groups which are small and informal with group facilitators to help people to feel at ease.</p> \n<p>With Step Out Ireland, you have somewhere to go where you are understood, listened to, and valued. We are committed to their goal of becoming one of the main pillars of support for people with SAD in Ireland, ensuring that no one with this condition feels alone.</p>",

            "description": "<p>Sacred Harp is an American four part harmony folk singing tradition from with songs dating from the 16th through the 20th centuries, is characterised by haunting harmonies, traditional modes, raucous songs, serene hymns, fast fugues, and high-energy anthems. The term Sacred Harp refers to the human voice and is also name of the tune book from which we sing, first published in 1844 and most recently revised in 1991. The shape-note system uses squares, triangles, circles and diamonds corresponding to notes in the scale, making the music easy to sing for beginners and experienced alike. The Sacred Harp Singers of Cork have been singing since 2009. We do not have rehearsals, we simply sing for pure enjoyment. There is no conductor or director - anyone who wishes to choose and lead a song from the book can do so. We sing every Thursday from 7-9pm in the Unitarian Church, Prince's St, often followed by a social beverage.</p>\n<p>We sing in full natural voice, so it's pretty loud, making it a great environment for beginners to build confidence in their voices. New singers of all levels of experience are always welcome - no prior sight reading ability necessary. Just turn up any Thursday and sing with us!</p>\n<p>We sing every Thursday.
